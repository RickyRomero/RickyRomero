## Hi! I'm Ricky. ðŸ‘‹

[I'm a designer and frontend developer][about-homepage] in Silicon Valley, and I've been at [this whole thing][about-about] for over 15 years. My jargon soup includes riviting terms like HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, node.js, React, jQuery, SQL, Docker, Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, UIKit, PHP, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, After Effects, and so on.

Here are some of the projects I've been involved in:

### QuickBooks

I currently work at [Intuit][intuit], where I design and build prototype interfaces for new [QuickBooks][intuit-quickbooks] features. I also designed many marketing pages for Intuit, including [the 2014-2018 Intuit homepage][intuit-archived-homepage].

### Konfabulator

[Konfabulator][konfabulator] was a shareware product that invented [mini programs called Widgets][konfabulator-widgets] written in [JavaScript][konfabulator-js]. Widgets could show any info you wanted on your desktop with beautiful alpha-composited graphics (something that was very novel at the time). I joined the team early on, building Widgets and approving third-party Widgets for the [Widget Gallery][konfabulator-gallery]. When [Yahoo!][konfabulator-yahoo] [acquired the product][konfabulator-acquired], I moved to the Bay Area and joined full-time as a frontend engineer.

### OpenEmu

[OpenEmu][openemu] is the best way to play classic games on your Mac. I provided [a suite of high-quality controller illustrations][openemu-controllers] and updated all of the interface graphics for Retina displays. I still contribute to this project on occasion.

### Shut Up

[Shut Up][shutup] is an open-source project for hiding visitor comments on all websites. It spans multiple repositories:

- [shutup.css][shutup-css]: A [user stylesheet][shutup-user-stylesheet] by [Steven Frank][shutup-stevenf], used with permission in the projects below
- [Shut Up WebExtension][shutup-webextension]: A cross-platform extension supporting Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera
- [Shut Up for Mac][shutup-macos]: A native Swift app containing a Safari App Extension and Content Blocker
- [Shut Up for iPhone/iPad][shutup-ios]: A native Swift app containing a Content Blocker
