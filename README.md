## Hi! I'm Ricky. ðŸ‘‹

[I'm a designer and frontend developer][about-homepage] in Silicon Valley, and I've been [at it][about-about] for over 15 years. Some of my skills include HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, node.js, React, jQuery, SQL, Docker, Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, UIKit, PHP, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, and After Effects.

I just made a brand-new portfolio to showcase my most recent work. [You should take a look][about-portfolio] if your teem needs someone with these skills.

Here are some of the projects I've been involved in:

### QuickBooks

[QuickBooks][intuit-quickbooks] is a powerful web app for accounting made by [Intuit][intuit]. At Intuit, I designed and built prototype interfaces for new QuickBooks features. I also designed many marketing pages, including [the 2014-2018 Intuit homepage][intuit-archived-homepage].

### Konfabulator

[Konfabulator][konfabulator] was a shareware product that invented [mini programs called Widgets][konfabulator-widgets] written in [JavaScript][konfabulator-js]. Widgets could show any info you wanted on your desktop with beautiful alpha-composited graphics (something that was very novel at the time). I joined the team early on, building Widgets and approving third-party Widgets for the [Widget Gallery][konfabulator-gallery]. When [Yahoo!][konfabulator-yahoo] [acquired the product][konfabulator-acquired], I moved to the Bay Area and joined full-time as a frontend engineer.

### OpenEmu

[OpenEmu][openemu] is the best way to play classic games on your Mac. I provided [a suite of high-quality controller illustrations][openemu-controllers] and updated all of the interface graphics for Retina displays. I still contribute to this project on occasion.

### Shut Up

[Shut Up][shutup] is an open-source project for hiding visitor comments on all websites. I built several browser extensions which cover all major browsers. The project spans multiple repositories:

- [shutup.css][shutup-css]: A [user stylesheet][shutup-user-stylesheet] by [Steven Frank][shutup-stevenf], used with permission in the projects below
- [Shut Up WebExtension][shutup-webextension]: A cross-platform extension supporting Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera
- [Shut Up for Mac][shutup-macos]: A native Swift app containing a Safari App Extension and Content Blocker
- [Shut Up for iPhone/iPad][shutup-ios]: A native Swift app containing a Content Blocker
